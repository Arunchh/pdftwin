## Phase 2 — after 50–100 clicks/day

**Explicitly deferred per product decision:**

### Cloud workspace sync

- Supabase Storage for Pro users  
- Files follow account across devices  
- Significant ongoing maintenance — only after traffic justifies it  

### Business tier

- 3–5 seats, shared workspace  
- Usage dashboard / audit log  
- $19–24/mo — targets agencies, small legal/accounting teams  

### Other

- API tier for developers ($49–99/mo)  
- Referral program (1 month Pro for referrer + referee)  

---

## Phase 3 — toward $3–5K/mo

- Expand tool count based on search demand (avoid 46-tool scatter)  
- Build in public (weekly stats)  
- AI tool directory listings  
- Client-side compress (lighter preset or Ghostscript WASM)  
- Hybrid PDF→Word (simple text PDFs client-side, complex server-side)  

---

## Out of scope (for now)

- Watermarks on free tier — **never**  
- Daily limits on client-side organize/convert tools (except merge batch on free)  
- Business tier before traction gate  
- Full ihatepdf-style 46-tool breadth — focus beats scatter
